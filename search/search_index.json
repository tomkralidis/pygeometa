Leveraging the simple but powerful YAML format, pygeometa can generate metadata in numerous standards. Users can also create their own custom metadata formats which can be plugged into pygeometa for custom metadata format output. For developers, pygeometa provides a Pythonic API that allows developers to tightly couple metadata generation within their systems and integrate nicely into metadata production pipelines. The project supports various metadata formats out of the box including ISO 19115, the WMO Core Metadata Profile, and the WIGOS Metadata Standard. Can't find the format you're looking for? Element(s) missing from a given format? Feel free to open an issue ! pygeometa has minimal dependencies (install is less than 50K), and provides a flexible extension mechanism leveraging the Jinja2 templating system. pygeoapi is open source and released under an MIT license . Features simple YAML-based configuration extensible: template architecture allows for easy addition of new metadata formats flexible: use as a command-line tool or integrate as a library History Started in 2009, pygeometa originated within an internal project called pygdm, which provided generic geospatial data management functions. pygdm (now end of life) was used for generating MSC/CMC geospatial metadata. pygeometa was pulled out of pygdm to focus on the core requirement of generating geospatial metadata within a real-time environment and automated workflows.

Let's go! For Users Installation You require Python 3 or greater to use pygeometa. The easiest way to install pygeometa is using pip: pip install pygeometa This will install the latest stable release. If you are looking to work with pygeometa from source, see the For Developers section for more information. Workflow The basic pygeometa workflow is: Create a 'metadata control file' YAML file that contains metadata information Modify the sample.yml example pygeometa supports nesting MCFs together, allowing providing a single MCF for common metadata parameters (e.g. common contact information) Refer to the Metadata Control File Reference documentation Run pygeometa for the .yml file with a specified target metadata schema Running # generate an ISO document to stdout pygeometa generate-metadata --mcf=path/to/file.yml --schema=iso19139 # generate an ISO document and save to disk pygeometa generate-metadata --mcf=path/to/file.yml --schema=iso19139 --output=some_file.xml # generate an ISO document, save to disk and set verbosity (ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG) for debugging issues pygeometa generate-metadata --mcf=path/to/file.yml --schema=iso19139 --output=some_file.xml --verbosity=DEBUG # to use your own defined schema: pygeometa generate-metadata --mcf=path/to/file.yml --schema_local=/path/to/my-schema --output=some_file.xml Migration Migrating old MCFs to YAML pygeometa provides a migrate utility to convert legacy MCFs into YAML: pygeometa migrate --mcf=path/to/file.mcf # to stdout pygeometa migrate --mcf=path/to/file.mcf --output=some_file.yml # to file The migrate utility doesn't support migrating comments from legacy MCFs to YAML MCFs.

However, below are some suggestions: use .yml as file extension name the MCF basename the same as the dataset (e.g. foo.shp , foo.yml ) To add a comment in a MCF, a line that begins with a hash tag ( # ) will be ignored If you have a colon ( : ) in your text / value, use quotation marks ( \" or ' ) on either side of your text to avoid mapping errors when parsing the YAML file Version format MCFs are versioned using X.Y (MAJOR.MINOR changes) format. If a non supported MCF version is provided, pygeometa will throw an error and stop processing the MCF. Thus, the user must provide a valid and supported MCF version to generate the metadata. Encoding The MCF MUST be utf8 encoded. That is all. Is your MCF Encoded as UTF8? # editing in vim # :set encoding=utf8 # pasting in vim # in insert mode, hit CTRL-V $CODE, where $CODE is as per http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/charset # to see how the file is actually encoded on disk file --mime-encoding file.txt file -i file.txt # to convert from one encoding to another iconv -f iso8859-1 -t utf-8 file.yml > file.yml.new Nesting MCFs In the case where the user is generating metadata for multiple datasets which have common information, it becomes efficient to nest MCF together. pygeometa allows chaining MCFs to inherit values from other MCFs. Example: multiple datasets MCFs can refer a single MCF that contain contact information common to all those datasets. To use MCF nesting: At the top of any section of a MCF add base_mcf: foo.yml Specify the corresponding section in the base_mcf file Notes about nesting MCFs: You can refer to one base_mcf per section of a MCF Multiple sections can refer to the same base_mcf file When a parameter is defined in both the base_mcf file and the current MCF, it's always the current MCF that overwrites the base_mcf file MCFs can be nested in chains, meaning a MCF can be use a 'child' MCF and be used by a 'parent' MCF Sections mcf Property Name Mandatory/Optional Description Example Reference version Mandatory version of MCF format 1.0 pygeometa metadata Property Name Mandatory/Optional Description Example Reference identifier Mandatory unique identifier for this metadata file 11800c2c-e6b9-11df-b9ae-0014c2c00eab ISO 19115:2003 Section B.2.1 language Mandatory primary language used for documenting metadata, the metadata records themselves can be provided in multiple languages nonetheless en ISO 19115:2003 Section B.2.1 charset Mandatory full name of the character coding standard used for the metadata set utf8 ISO 19115:2003 Section B.2.1 parentidentifier Optional file identifier of the metadata to which this metadata is a subset 11800c2c-e6b9-11df-b9ae-0014c2c33ebe ISO 19115:2003 Section B.2.1 hierarchylevel Mandatory level to which the metadata applies (must be one of 'series', 'software', 'featureType', 'model', 'collectionHardware', 'collectionSession', 'nonGeographicDataset', 'propertyType', 'fieldSession', 'dataset', 'service', 'attribute', 'attributeType', 'tile', 'feature', 'dimensionGroup' dataset ISO 19115:2003 Section B.2.1 datestamp Mandatory date that the metadata was created, pygeometa supports specifying the $date$ or $datetime$ variable to update the date value at run time 2000-11-11 or 2000-01-12T11:11:11Z ISO 19115:2003 Section B.2.1 dataseturi Mandatory Uniformed Resource Identifier (URI) of the dataset to which the metadata applies urn:x-wmo:md:int.wmo.wis::http://geo.woudc.org/def/data/uv-radiation/uv-irradiance ISO 19115:2003 Section B.2.1 spatial Property Name Mandatory/Optional Description Example Reference datatype Mandatory method used to represent geographic information in the dataset (must be one of 'vector', 'grid', 'textTable', 'tin', 'stereoModel', 'video') vector Section B.5.26 geomtype Mandatory name of point or vector objects used to locate zero-, one-, two-, or threedimensional spatial locations in the dataset (must be one of 'complex', 'composite', 'curve', 'point', 'solid', 'surface') point ISO 19115:2003 B.5.15 crs Mandatory EPSG code identifier 4326 ISO 19115:2003 B.2.7.3 bbox Mandatory geographic position of the dataset, formatted as 'minx,miny,maxx,maxy' -141,42,-52,84 ISO 19115:2003 Section B.3.1.2 identification Property Name Mandatory/Optional Description Example Reference doi Optional Digital Object Identifier (DOI) 12345 ISO 19115:2003 Section B.3.2.1 language Mandatory language(s) used within the dataset.

Multiple languages support pygeometa supports default and alternate languages in ISO metadata. Multilingual support is driven by the following sections in [metadata] : language : 2 letter language code (i.e. en , fr ) of primary language language_alternate : 2 letter language code (i.e. en , fr ) of secondary language Example: [metadata] language:en language_alternate:fr ... If language_alternate is not defined or missing, pygeometa assumes a single language. Values which support multilingual values can be specified with _xx suffixes to denote the respective language.
